## 🚀 Just Launched: My Multiple Prediction System using Machine Learning! 🧠✨



Proud to share a hands-on project I built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit, combining three powerful AI-driven tools in one app:



📚## Book Recommendation System:



 🔍 Powered by TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, this feature gives personalized book suggestions based on your favorite titles, authors, genres, or even descriptions.

 Just type in what you love to read, and let the ML model do the magic! 📖✨



📰 ## Fake News Detection:



 Using NLP, TF-IDF Vectorizer, and a trained classification model, the app can identify whether a news headline or content is Fake or Real in seconds!

 Combat misinformation with just one click! 🔍✅❌



✍️ ## Handwritten Digit Recognition:



 Upload any digit image and this module (trained on MNIST with TensorFlow/Keras) will instantly predict it using deep learning.

 Computer Vision in action! 🔢📷

🎥 I’ve even demoed this application in action—watch the video to see how it performs live!



🔧 Tech Stack:

 Python | Streamlit | Sklearn | TensorFlow | OpenCV | NLTK | Pandas | NumPy



💡 This project helped me combine multiple ML concepts—NLP, CV, Recommender Systems, and Real-Time Inference—into a single cohesive web app. A great learning journey!
